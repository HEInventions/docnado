# Bullet Point Lists

Lists in Markdown are nice and easy:

* Look
* at
* this
* bullet point list

which is defined as so
```markdown
* Look
* at
* this
* bullet point list
```

# Numbered Lists

Number the lists without keeping track of numbers:

0. Such
0. as
0. in
0. this
1. list

```markdown
0. Such
0. as
0. in
0. this
1. list
```

# Progress Lists

A progress list is a list of checkboxes:

* [ ] This is one.
* [X] This is two. It happens to be a long list item designed to test how the styling copes with the multiples lines generated.
* [ ] This is three.
```markdown
* [ ] This is one.
* [X] This is two. It happens to be a long list item designed to test how the styling copes with the multiples lines generated.
* [ ] This is three.
```
