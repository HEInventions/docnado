# Why Docnado?
Docnado was born because we just wanted to write documentation with a decent out of the box style, a nav system, and support for videos.

Today docnado implements markdown plus videos, YouTube, PDFs, CSVs, code highlighting, file downloads, lists, tables, meta-data, custom templates, callouts.

You can store all your docs in version control, so you have complete control of your data.

Advanced tools allow you to check that all files referenced (i.e. images) have corresponding files on disk, and vice-versa, that all files in the docs are referenced in the text. You can also tie your documentation into continuious integration steps that make sure that any changes people make do not break any other documents and follow a consistent language and style guide.
